# 2FA Prettifier

Turns messy 2FA seeds into XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, all capitalised and in 4-character blocks. I made this since I store all my 2FA seeds in an encrypted vault just as backup, and I was bored so I made them look pretty.

This was made in GTK and Python. It works on Linux with `python-gobject` installed. I'm unsure if it works on other platforms.
